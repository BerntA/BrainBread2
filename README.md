### Introduction
BrainBread 2, also known as BrainBread: Source, has been in development for almost a decade. 
The goal was to rebuild the ancient master-piece mod for Half-Life 1, BrainBread.

In 2016 BrainBread 2 was released on Steam as a standalone sourcemod. 
It contained a vast spectrum of gamemodes, maps, weapons and customization.
Now anyone can feel free to contribute to this development, now that BrainBread 2 is open source.
